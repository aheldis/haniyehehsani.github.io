## About Me
I am a CS Ph.D. student at University of Maryland since Spring 2023, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/">Prof. Soheil Feizi</a>.
  My research mainly revolves around Foundation and Multimodal Models,
  covering topics such as image generation, vision-language models, and interpretability and robustness of machine learning methods.

## Research Interests

- **Generative AI:** diffusion models, multimodal models, large language models.
- **Trustworthy AI:** adversarial robustness, deepfake detection.
- **AI Interpretability:** spurious features, failure-mode detection.

## News
- **[Oct. 2023]** Our work "Robustness of AI-Image Detectors: Fundamental Limits and Practical Attacks"
  was covered in news articles such as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-watermarking-issues/">Wired</a>, 
  <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/02/watermarking_security_checks/">The Register</a>,
  and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/10/researchers-show-how-easy-it-is-to-defeat-ai-watermarks/">ArtTechnica</a>.
- **[Sep. 2023]** Our paper "ZeroGrad: Costless conscious remedies for catastrophic overfitting in the FGSM adversarial training" was published by Elsveir Journal.
- **[Jun. 2023]** Our paper "Robust Routing Made Easy: Reinforcing Networks Against Non-Benign Faults" was published by EEE/ACM Transactions on Networking.
