## About Me
I am a graduate student in computer Science at UCLA advised by Prof. Majid Sarrafzadeh.

As a kid, I always found it hard to decide where I could fit in and what I wanted to do. Machine Learning has always given me the ambition to think outside of the box. It allows me to be more creative, combine different skills, and never get bored while doing so. This is why I decided to opt for this field of study.

I am mostly interested in the intersection of Machine Learning with other fields, such as Computer Vision, Robotics, and Healthcare. 

## Research Interests

- **Trustworthy AI** 
- **Adversarial Attacks and Robustness** 
- **Interpretability**
- **Optical Flow and Scene Flow Estimation**
- **Theoretical Machine Learning**
